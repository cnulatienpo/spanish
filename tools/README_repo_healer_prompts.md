# Codex Repo Healer Prompts — Consolidated

This consolidated file lists v11–v14 prompts so you can generate one healer at a time without touching old files. Use **add-only** commits to avoid complex merges.

- v11 — Bash + jq (portable)
- v12 — Make + awk (ultra‑minimal)
- v13 — Python stdlib‑only
- v14 — Node ESM minimal

> To keep merges clean, generating a healer should only add new files under `tools/` and should not delete or rewrite existing content.
