      "story": "It began as a shout across distance, not a polite word. The silent h is the ghost of an old breath that used to start the sound. Over time the two calls fused into 'hola,' a pure signal of safe entry between people.",
      "wrap_line": "“Hola” is a fossil of three worlds — the Arabic breath, the Romance echo, and the human need to be heard across space. It’s the oldest tech-support ticket in the world: “Can you hear me?”"

      "word": "adiós",
      "origin": "From the phrase 'a Dios' — literally 'to God,' once said as 'Te encomiendo a Dios' (I commend you to God).",
