    "english": "“Adiós” is a release, not a goodbye — a tiny ritual that hands the person you just met back to the universe.",
    "origin": "From the phrase 'a Dios' — literally 'to God,' once said as 'Te encomiendo a Dios' (I commend you to God).",
    "story": "It began as a blessing when parting. Speech wore it down to just two sounds, but the wish for protection stayed. Even casually, every 'adiós' still carries a trace of care.",

    "english": "Now",
    "origin": "From Latin 'ad horam' — 'at this hour.' Over centuries, Spanish pressed the phrase into one smooth sound: 'ahora.'",
    "story": "In old speech, 'ahora' literally meant 'at this hour.' It carried the sense of immediacy — something happening in the exact beat of time you are standing in. Today it still holds that pulse. When you say 'ahora,' you’re calling life to attention.",
    "example": "Use it freely inside English to anchor the moment: 'I’m ready ahora.' 'We go ahora.' 'It’s happening ahora.' The word itself pulls the action into the present.",

    "pos": "adverb",

    "english": "Before",
    "origin": "From Latin 'ante' — before, in front of. Over time, Spanish added a soft 's' to let the word hold many memories at once.",
    "story": "When you say 'antes,' you’re not counting; you’re reaching backward in the order of things. It can mean 'earlier,' 'first,' or simply 'in the past.' It’s the word you use when you rewind life by one frame.",
    "example": "You can mix it into English until it feels natural: 'I worked antes.'  'I left antes.'  'I ate antes.'  The word alone marks what happened first.",

    "english": "Yesterday",
    "origin": "From Latin 'heri' — the day before today. Over centuries Spanish added the open 'a' in front, like a backward step.",
    "story": "Before clocks, people measured time by light. Yesterday was 'the last sun.' So when you say 'ayer,' you’re pointing toward warmth that’s still close but no longer here.",
    "example": "You can drop 'ayer' into an English sentence while you learn: 'I worked ayer.'  'I already took out garbage ayer.'  You don’t need to change the verbs yet — the word itself places the action in the past.",

    "english": "I walk.",
    "origin": "‘Caminar’ comes from Latin *camminus,* related to *caminus,* meaning 'path, road, or passage.'",
    "story": "It’s built from the same root that gives us 'camino' — the road itself. So 'yo camino' literally means 'I road,' or 'I path.' The verb is movement embodied: each step is a small creation of direction.",

    "origin": "From Latin 'de ex post' — 'from out of after.' Spanish compressed it into one smooth wave: 'después,' meaning beyond this moment.",
    "story": "When you say 'después,' you’re promising continuation. It’s the space between actions — the bridge from one event to the next. Every story and plan moves through 'después.'",
    "example": "Blend it into English as you learn: 'I’ll work después.'  'I’ll go después.'  'We’ll eat después.'  The word itself carries you forward.",

    "origin": "‘Estoy’ comes from the verb *estar,* whose ancestor is Latin *stare,* meaning 'to stand, to stay in a place.'",
    "story": "Long before it meant 'to be,' *stare* simply meant 'to stand upright, to remain for a time.' Spanish kept that sense of standing in a space. So when you say 'estoy,' you’re not declaring what you are—you’re describing how and where you stand right now. It’s presence in motion, not identity. 'Bien' comes from Latin *bene*—well, good—so 'estoy bien' means 'I stand well in this moment.'",

    "story": "Long ago, 'felix' was not only an emotion; it was a wish — to live in good fortune.  In Spanish, 'feliz' still carries that wish.  It’s the quiet spark that lights the word 'felicidad' — happiness itself.",
    "example": "Use it right away with what you already know: 'Estoy feliz hoy.'  'Estoy feliz porque trabajo.'  'Estoy en la casa feliz.'  The word slips easily into sentences you can already build.",

    "story": "The same root gave English its words 'grace' and 'gratitude.' In older Spanish, 'dar las gracias' literally meant 'to give the graces'—to hand someone a bit of your own good fortune. When you say 'gracias,' you’re offering a spark of that grace back to the world.",

    "origin": "From old Spanish 'hala' (Arabic ḥā lah – come on!) and 'ola' (a Romance call for attention).",
    "story": "It began as a shout across distance, not a polite word. The silent h is the ghost of an old breath that used to start the sound. Over time the two calls fused into 'hola,' a pure signal of safe entry between people.",

    "story": "Every day begins, burns, and shortens into memory. 'Hoy' carries that flicker — it’s the moment still burning. Long ago, people marked 'today' by the fire they kept alive until night. The word still feels like that flame.",

    "story": "Every language has a word for the promise of the next sunrise.  In Spanish, that promise is 'mañana.'  It began as 'morning' and grew to mean 'tomorrow' — the day you can’t touch yet.",

    "story": "The phrase comes from Latin *clamāre*, 'to call out.' Spanish turned that outward shout inward—'me' makes it reflexive, a call toward yourself. It’s how Spanish builds identity through action.",

    "story": "Long ago, 'gusto' was about literal taste — the pleasure of flavor. Spanish kept that sensory meaning in how it greets people. When you say 'mucho gusto,' you’re not being formal; you’re saying, 'meeting you tastes good to me.'",

    "story": "Every language needs a way to say that something simply does not happen. In Spanish, 'nunca' is that refusal — short, firm, unbending. When you say it, time stops stretching; it folds shut.",
    "example": "Try it inside English until it feels natural: 'I go there nunca.' 'I felt that nunca.' 'I’ll do that nunca.' It tells the listener that the action doesn’t belong anywhere on the line of time.",

    "story": "‘Pero’ doesn’t erase what came before; it adds weight to what follows. In Spanish conversation, it’s the sound of honesty — admitting that something else is also true. Every story needs its turning point, and Spanish keeps that turn inside this single word.",
    "example": "Use it inside English until it feels natural: 'I work, pero I’m tired.' 'I walk, pero slowly.' 'I live here, pero I go tomorrow.'  The word connects one idea with another without ending the thought.",

    "story": "Originally, 'por favor' was transactional: a polite request for advantage or help. Over centuries it softened into pure courtesy. Yet it still holds the echo of that first bargain — every 'por favor' carries a trace of humility, a reminder that kindness runs on permission.",

    "story": "At first it meant 'by what road.' Over centuries it became the way people showed connection between ideas. When you say 'porque,' you’re tracing the path from action to reason — from what you do to why you do it.",
    "example": "You can start using it right now inside English: 'I work porque I want.' 'I walk porque I can.' 'I live porque I live.' The word itself creates the link between what you do and why you do it.",

    "story": "‘Tampoco’ was built to soften refusal. It’s how you stay connected while saying no. When someone says, 'I don’t go,' and you reply 'yo tampoco,' you’re standing with them in stillness — sharing the same absence instead of opposing it.",
    "example": "Use it easily inside English until it fits: 'I don’t work tampoco.' 'I don’t walk tampoco.' 'I’m not ready tampoco.' It adds gentle agreement to any negative thought.",

    "story": "In early Latin, 'tristis' was used for both weather and people — a gray sky, a heavy heart.  In Spanish, it still connects the two.  You can say 'el día está triste' — the day is sad — or 'estoy triste' — I’m sad.  It paints the world in quieter colors.",
    "example": "Use it naturally with what you know: 'Estoy triste hoy.'  'Estoy triste porque trabajo mucho.'  'Estoy en la casa triste.'  The feeling fits anywhere — it just changes the light of the sentence.",

    "story": "When Spanish speakers say '¿Cómo estás?,' they’re not asking for a label like happy or sad. They’re asking about your stance in the world — how you’re holding yourself, how steady you feel.
