# Tamale Town U.S.A. — Mobile Release Pack (Capacitor + Vite/React)

This pack helps you wrap your existing **Vite/React** app with **Capacitor** and ship to **iOS App Store** and **Google Play** fast.

**What you do:**
1) Install Capacitor deps → copy configs → merge scripts.
2) Add PWA bits (manifest + service worker).
3) Build & sync → open native projects.
4) Generate icons/splash → sign → upload.

See `checklists/Release_Checklist.md` for the full path.
